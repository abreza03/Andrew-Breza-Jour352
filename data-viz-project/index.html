            <h1>Amidst a poor start to the season, will the Bucks trade Giannis Antetokounmpo?</h1>
               
            <h2>Andrew Fenichel takes us through his best fits for the Greek Freak if a trade occurs</h2>
             
            <h3 id="byline">By: Andrew Breza</h3>
                         
            <h4 id="date">December 17, 2025</h4>
               
            <p>The Milwaukee Bucks, one of the NBA's best teams over the last five seasons, have started the 2025 campaign at 11-16, ranking 10th in the Eastern Conference.</p>
            
            <p> Despite winning the NBA title in 2021, the Bucks have consistently come up short in the playoffs since. Although they've taken multiple big swings in the trade market and in free agency in the last few years, nothing has gotten Milwaukee back to the big stage.</p>
            
            <p> Milwaukee now finds themselves in a sort of Mexican standoff with their superstar player: despite Giannis not pushing for a trade, he hasn't shut down the possibility of it, either.</p>
            
            <p> This isn't the first time this has happened. In years past, the Bucks' front office have pulled off a blockbuster move for a superstar to pair with the Greek Freak in an effort to make him happy. Jrue Holiday in 2021, Damian Lillard in 2023, and Myles Turner in 2025.</p>
            
            <p> However, that course of action now proves to be difficult. Because of their recent history of big moves, the Bucks are left with minimal draft capital - not owning a first round pick until 2031. The liklihood of landing another star with those resources are slim to none.</p>
            
            <p> With Giannis sidelined due to a calf injury, the Bucks have looked sluggish. To make things even more difficult, Giannis is under contract for the next three seasons with a cap hit of $54 million, $58 million, and $63 million respectively. The Bucks simply don't have the money to pay another star player.</p>
            
            <p> With all this in mind, a trade doesn't seem out of the question. The Bucks may look to completely reset, while Giannis gets the chance to chase another ring with a contender. But who are the teams capable of pulling off such a move? </p>

            <p> As a multi-media intern for Andrew's channels this semester, I've helped him write and edit scripts, conduct research, and create graphics and polls.</p>
            
            <p> For this topic, I decided to take a more creative approach in place of creating a simple rankings chart: a March Madness style tournament based on Andrew's rankings of destinations for Giannis.</p>
            
            <p> I separated the teams into two divisions (mostly aligning with their actual conference, but not entirely).  I then followed a similar seeding style to college basketball's annual tournament, giving the one seeds a bye since there are not enough teams to have #16 seeds. Outside of that, the matchups are the same: No. 2 vs. No. 15, No. 5 vs. No. 12, No. 8 vs. No. 9, etc. The numbers on the right correspond to Andrew's total rankings. </p>
            
            <p> I then expanded upon Flourish's base "tournament" graphic, creating two charts in one, adding all the team logos and respective rounds. </p>
            
            <p> Although it's an unorthodox way of conveying the message, in content creation, different and unique graphics help creators stand out. Andrew liked it, and he may be posting it somewhere soon.</p>
